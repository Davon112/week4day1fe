            <div className="summary">
                <p>Thor is one of the gods of Asgard and the son of the Asgardian king Odin. 
                    In addition to his Asgardian strength and extended lifespan, 
                    Thor wields control over the weather, including rain and lightning. 
                    He also carries the enchanted hammer Mjolnir that enhances his abilities 
                    and grants him the ability to fly. Thor was first introduced as the alter ego 
                    of surgeon Donald Blake who acquired Thor's power, but this was later revealed to
                     be a fabrication by Thor's father. Thor has since assumed other human identities
                      and at times ruled as king of Asgard.</p>
